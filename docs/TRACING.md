# OpenTelemetry trace export

go-toolchain can export build pipeline timings as OpenTelemetry traces, enabling visualization in Grafana Tempo or any OTLP-compatible backend.

Trace export is controlled entirely by standard `OTEL_*` environment variables. When `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset, no traces are exported and there is zero overhead.

```bash
# Export traces to a local collector
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 go-toolchain

# Export to Grafana Cloud Tempo
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic $(echo -n 'user:api-key' | base64)" \
go-toolchain
```

**Span hierarchy:**
- Root span `go-toolchain` covering the entire build
  - Worker spans, all named `build.worker`, distinguished by the `build.worker.id` attribute (`main`, `deps`, `worker-1`, etc.)
    - Step spans (e.g., `go mod tidy`, `go vet ./...`). Cross-compile steps collapse into a static `build.compile` span carrying `build.target.os` and `build.target.arch` attributes (e.g. `linux`/`amd64`) instead of encoding the platform in the span name.

All spans use `INTERNAL` kind. Success and failure are reported via span status (`OK` / `ERROR`) rather than boolean attributes. Resource attributes include `github.sha`, `github.repository`, `github.ref`, and `github.run_id` when running in GitHub Actions.

`cacheprog` also exports a `cacheprog.http_error` span for each HTTP error from the remote cache (`web put`, `web get`, `web batch get`), with attributes `cacheprog.op`, `http.response.status_code`, `cacheprog.action_id`, and a truncated `cacheprog.body`. When OTel is not configured, these spans are skipped. Stderr only emits an aggregated summary line per (operation, status, body) at most every 30 seconds (plus one final flush at shutdown), so a flaky remote no longer floods the terminal with one line per failed request.
